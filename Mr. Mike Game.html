        <p style="font-size:2vw">The pixelated man depicted to the right is Mr. Mike. He will stand in the same place throughout the whole game. The player should click the space bar in order to help Mr. Mike jump over the bugs that are running towards him. If a bug collides into Mr. Mike, the player must start over. Try to score as many points as possible.</p>
